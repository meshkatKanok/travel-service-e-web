    <p>SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL..From analysts and engineers to IT decision makers, many are familiar with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and the Structured Query Language (SQL) used to interact with them. While these terms refer to a decades-old paradigm which remains a wide standard, today the sheer variety and depth of database systems can be dizzying. Whatâ€™s more, rising volumes of unstructured data, availability of storage and processing power, and evolving analytic requirements have generated interest in fundamentally different technologies.

Collectively known as NoSQL, these popular alternatives to traditional RDBMSs show promise for a variety of modern use cases.

To make informed decisions about which to use, practitioners should be aware of the differences between SQL, NoSQL, individual Database Management Systems (DBMS) and languages, as well as the situations each is best-suited for, and how the landscape is changing</p>
